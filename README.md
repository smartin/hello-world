# hello-world

It's quite exciting to create my first GitHub Repository, Branch and Commit all on the same day!

I have an idea that will require javascript, which I started leaning yesterday, and it seemed like a good idea to start working with GitHub as well to keep track of code for different projects.

Ask me about mutliplatform content production and gardening : I'm @splambo online.
